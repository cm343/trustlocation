It is 3 years later now my case is settled and Fast Funds got their money back. I must say that 3 years without worrying about making a loan payment or getting collection calls is well worth the fee.

The level of service was Exceptional.\n\nThere are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.\n\nA businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.\n\nAs a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.\n\nDesign your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.\n\nHire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.\n\nJason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.\n\nAs mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.\n\nI have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.  My glowing review was earned each step of the way by Jason and the good people at Fast Funds of Hollywood, Florida."

With his years of experience and affiliation with the company by the name of \"Fast Funds\" which are owned and operated by Mr. Bruce and Jason. Fast funds specializes in settlement cash advances. What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact \"Fast Funds\" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation. If it wasn't for these three Angels I would be homeless, Literally! God places people in your life for a reason and these three Angels have been a blessing to my life.

Before I could do that, I ran out of talent and wadded up the front end on my RZR cracking the frame in the process. I called Alternative the following day (on a Sunday) and surprisingly James answered my call. He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.\n\nThe shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another \"shop\" had slapped together.\n\nTheir pics speak for themselves. Believe me when I say their work is very clean and thorough. Solid team of guys that do things right the first time. Extremely hard to find in this industry.\n\nHighly recommend!"

I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!\n\nI politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.\n\nI have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.\n\nHowever the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to \"dispose of it\". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to \"Ask family or friends to help\". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.\n\nI never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.\n\nBe warned!"
