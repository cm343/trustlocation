Courtney Albertson,-1,5,"Leslie is AMAZING! I participated in one of her Rainbow Shoots. To say that she encompassed my heart & my emotions of it all seems like a huge understatement. I've never felt the ABSOLUTE emotion in a photoshoot before! I mean, I cried -- and she captured it, ALL OF IT. Raw emotion. Love. It was truly breathtaking. I not only have photos of my rainbow babe & I to last a life time, I also bonded with several other Rainbow Mamas & that was incredible in its own right. Leslie is an amazing photographer, with a HUGE heart for her clients! 5 Stars!",Yes,No response available,0,Leslie Carbajal Photography,"['Photographer', 'Service establishment']","{'From the business': ['Identifies as Black-owned', 'Identifies as women-led']}",
Katie,-1,5,"My son started getting into electronic music using garage band and eventually Ableton. After seeing how he enjoyed making music, I scoured the internet looking for a school to teach that type of music and found Mix Major. We are so glad we did!

Bob Chadwick,-1,5,"This kind of technology-related music education is the future, and founder, Eric Jao, is out there on the cutting edge! My son, 14, just finished a week of summer camp at Mix Major. It was a smash hit! He had no prior experience. This class engaged him. He loved it.  It enabled his creativity. It released a chunk of his inner creativity that we did not know existed. The kids go at their own pace and get to see results...and that builds confidence! Great experience! Bravo Eric!",No,"{'time': 1562525623679, 'text': 'Thanks so much Bob!  Your son was a fast learner and he was definitely engaged throughout the camp.  I hope he continues to build on what he learned.  Your son already had a lot of creative ideas.

Jean Sadler,-1,1,"(Translated by Google) My worst internet ordering experience.
After more than 4 months of waiting, no delivery news.
I've never had to send so many emails for information, I've been told all kinds of excuses.
Until requesting a refund.
I wasn't even answered anymore,
I had to call 4 times in China with a person who spoke very poor English, and struggled for several weeks to get my money back
