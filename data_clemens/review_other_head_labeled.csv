There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.

Recently, I was injured on the job. Stressed about apartment eviction and car/ insurance payments. These three are my biggest bills.

What does that mean? Its a financial relief for anyone who's injured. With that injury comes with a settlement offer. Well, from first hand it takes time to accumulate all the evidence in your situation. That's when hard times hit and you should contact ""Fast Funds"" where Bruce/Jason will be more than happy to assist you in your financial situation.

Before I could do that, I ran out of talent and wadded up the front end on my RZR cracking the frame in the process. I called Alternative the following day (on a Sunday) and surprisingly James answered my call. He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

It was like pulling teeth just trying to schedule a visit with those people.  Communicating with them over missed phone calls and endless misunderstandings was just too much to bare, so I started looking for other solutions.

Five or Free sent out a technician names Tim very quickly to review the situation.  He was punctual, incredibly nice, and very patient and informative when explaining to me how the wiring was set up in my newly purchased home.  He presented me with multiple different options for moving forward at different price points, and wasn't pushy at all in going one way or the other.

Then, when Tim came back to do the actual work, some further analysis revealed that some of the scheduled work didn't in fact need to be done.  He made me immediately aware of this and reduced the cost of the visit accordingly.  Some less honest technicians may have simply said nothing and billed me for work they didn't eve do.

This is all I really need to say.  They were quick, punctual, very easy to work/communicate with, and just all around good people.  We will definitely be using them exclusively from here on out.

1) Knowledgeable/Thorough/Detailed/Meticulous/ Methodical - carefully inspected and corrected the wiring problems caused by the previous electrician, including the problems in the dark, narrow, cramped, crawl space under the house.

2) Professional/Great Customer Service - accommodated 2 work schedules, text reminders, arrival updates, arrived in a timely manner, polite, neat, tidy.

3) Patient/ Pleasant - had many lengthy discussions with us to make sure that we understood what, why and how they planned to repair the previous electrician's wiring mistakes.  Took before and after photos because we lived out-of-town.

They guarantee their work for 17 years so you know that their service is impeccable!  I would hire them again and highly recommend them!!!

Five or Free is an all-around first class company. The whole process has been thought out, from initial contact to mailing inspection permits. They EXPERTLY replaced an out-dated sub panel (which was a fire risk and no small task), and installed an EVSE from the main panel to the garage. The EVSE installation required a bit of logistics and some de-construction/construction. The result is that it's in just the right place for ease of use and looks very nice.
I asked one technician how to approach garage door repair companies and his great advice was a bonus. The folks at Five or Free are communicative, professional, honest, and most importantly, the electricians do excellent work.

There are many businesses designed to help people when they are in a less-than advantageous position.  Often, as customers in need of funds to sustain our living expenses we are desperate and have exhausted our resources leaving us few places to turn to and no power in the business relationship.

A businessman who suffered 3 heart failures over the last 18 months and the loss of my career as a result, this certainly was the case with me.

As a company, Fast Funds clearly understands their clientele and how to do this business right.

Design your business model in such a way that you are able to charge reasonable rates to your clients and still conduct business in a fair, ethical manner.

Hire good people with a high level of personal integrity and treat them with the same respect you insist they treat their clients with.  Pay them a wage sufficient to attract and keep quality employees and operate under a system that allows them to keep their integrity intact.

Jason was clear about the cost of the advance from the beginning.  The fee structure is easy to understand and there are no hidden charges or complicated scenarios to confuse the client.

As mentioned, the level of service was superb.  Highlighted by Jason's willingness to be helpful, answer questions, sometimes a little after hours.  He was clear about the process and what to expect without any hesitation that he may be held accountable for the statements he made.

I have been the owner of a service company with 30 employees and the manager of many others.  My name is Tom Hansen and I received my lawsuit advance December 17th, 2019.

He answered all my questions and walked me through the whole insurance process without even expecting me to bring my car to him. It was like we had known each other for years.

The shop is a couple hours from me but was well worth the drive. I ended up having a lot of problems with my insurance company dropping the ball and jacking me around. James was super patient, helped me out a ton with all the issues, was up front about every detail, and finally my RZR came back looking like nothing ever happened even with a full frame swap. They went above and beyond to clean up all my wiring that another ""shop"" had slapped together.

Their pics speak for themselves. Believe me when I say their work is very clean and thorough. Solid team of guys that do things right the first time. Extremely hard to find in this industry.

Highly recommend!",,"{'time': 1495658958540, 'text': 'Thank you Seth!'}",0x80c29dd709d02059:0x6e7d1dfbe9bd3293,GOOD

Ordered an expensive desk from Homary and was told 9 - 11 week delivery time. It took 21 weeks. I was very happy to wait and was very understanding due to the COVID situation however when the desk finally arrived, it was only one piece, with no legs! I was then told the remaining legs would arrive in 9 - 11 weeks again, but may be longer. I could not wait another 21 weeks as I work from home and have no where to sit!

I politely asked for a refund as I couldn't wait any longer and would just purchase a cheaper desk for now that could be delivered quickly.

I have only been refunded a partial amount and no idea why, as I should get the full refund - they are now ignoring my communications.

However the most frustrating and rude part of this process is that after my understanding for 21 weeks, I asked for the large/heavy piece of unusable desk they delivered to be picked up - I cannot move it and it is taking up my entire hall. I was told I have to ""dispose of it"". I explained it is too heavy and I can't afford to get someone to come and get it, I was then told to ""Ask family or friends to help"". I have no family or friends living near me and I found this so unhelpful and pretty assumptive and upsetting. It is now sitting in my hallway as a health and safety hazard, I am ¬£80 down as they haven't paid me a full refund and I have to order anew desk to work from after waiting 21 weeks.

I never review companies online as I understand mistakes happen but I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with this incompetent company.

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

We started with an introductory call and then an introductory course, during which he provided me direct teaching on the Ableton Live DAW to come up with a song from a prepared set of audio samples he had sent me to download prior to the session. This was all handled via the Zoom platform.

I decided to join his class on the spot, as I knew I had found someone who was very well-versed in 1-using Ableton, 2-producing electronic music, and 3-teaching.

I have been a teacher in the past, and have spent much of my adult life as a learner. It is easy for me to tell when someone has the patience, foresight, and knowledge to teach well. Eric fits the bill on all fronts.

From the music production side: I have not felt this alive in many years. Granted, I have had the goal of music production for more than a decade and I am just now getting around to seriously pursuing it. However, I think my experience is likely generalizable and not strictly confined to those who want to pursue music production seriously. The sheer act of creatively ""playing"" with music is something I think is probably built into the human psyche and human experience, and this class provides an outlet for that kind of artistic/human expression

Finally, I will say that in my brief dealings with Eric so far, I can tell that he has a kind heart and is truly trying to make the world a better -- and more music-filled -- place, one music-producer at a time.",,"{'time': 1612897650574, 'text': 'A little late on this but thanks so much Edward!'}",0x89b64806fedaaaab:0x2b43ebb391ac4622,GOOD

It was like pulling teeth just trying to schedule a visit with those people.  Communicating with them over missed phone calls and endless misunderstandings was just too much to bare, so I started looking for other solutions.

Five or Free sent out a technician names Tim very quickly to review the situation.  He was punctual, incredibly nice, and very patient and informative when explaining to me how the wiring was set up in my newly purchased home.  He presented me with multiple different options for moving forward at different price points, and wasn't pushy at all in going one way or the other.

Then, when Tim came back to do the actual work, some further analysis revealed that some of the scheduled work didn't in fact need to be done.  He made me immediately aware of this and reduced the cost of the visit accordingly.  Some less honest technicians may have simply said nothing and billed me for work they didn't eve do.

This is all I really need to say.  They were quick, punctual, very easy to work/communicate with, and just all around good people.  We will definitely be using them exclusively from here on out.

The first contractor I contacted, a specialist in such replacements, told me the panel had to be moved to meet code, the only suitable spot was in front of the house, but the City would not approve placement there due to esthetics.  He advised me to apply for a variance with the Planning department, which he predicted would take five months, and after that to call him again.  Needless to say, I checked with multiple other contractors and heard other opinions, but did not find one I trusted who seemed to know what they were talking about and quoted a reasonable price.  They all expected me to obtain approvals from the electrical supplier and government entities before they would start work.  Finally, I called Five or Free Electric.
The experience with Five or Free was a cut above all the others. They were prompt, confident, knowledgeable, and assured me they would handle any and all contact with government inspectors.

Five or Free is an all-around first class company. The whole process has been thought out, from initial contact to mailing inspection permits. They EXPERTLY replaced an out-dated sub panel (which was a fire risk and no small task), and installed an EVSE from the main panel to the garage.

Kenton came out for an estimate promptly and ed provided several facts and figures to work with, including a schedule of availability. He started shortly thereafter.

He performed the job himself with one helper. This is unusual as most contractors farm their work out to underlings and rarely show up on the job except to collect payment.

The work was completed quickly and professionally. Kenton was very easy to work with and flexible knowing that there was some uncertainty as to  how exactly the project was going to come out. The ultimate results were excellent. His prices were reasonable and although it was doubted whether we could keep the original floors, he made them come back to life and preserve our historic property.

Will recommend Reichen Refinishing in the future",,,0x89d30d2ffa56c4fd:0xac426c83b2b960ab,GOOD

The positives: Server management is easy and during their opening hours their support livechat is responsive.

Negatives: Multiple periods of downtime, some days in length. Discounts on future bills don't really make up for not being able to use my server. My server has been migrated onto a new machine/assigned a new IP at least once without me being notified resulting in me having to update domain DNS records. The company seems to have a cult like following who jump on anyone who has a genuine complaint and tries to raise this via their discord.

I have used other hosts in the past and could easily host the server myself, but thought it would remove the hassle by using a professional serer host. It did not.

1.0009774574094628e+20,Liko,1586363766650,1,"So just for a heads-up, this was posted on Trust Pilot, but was removed.

I was paying for the Herobrine package, which is ""unlimited"" RAM. I read the terms on that prior to purchasing: starts at 8gb and gets increased in increments of 2 up to 16gb, as needed. Fine, thats alright. I was expecting to need about 12 for my SMP server.

I opted for the upgraded support & management package, an extra $5/mo. This comes with +1 GB of ram for your server, neat.

Immediately upon starting my server for the first time (we transferred the world from a different host)- we were instantly struck with server issues. I requested more RAM, and they obliged- taking us up from 8 to 10. I then asked about my +1 from the extra package, which they said was applied as a +1 to the 8, bringing us to 9- then the ticket went through for 8-10, bringing our total up to 10. I lost my +1, Irritating, but oh well. At least I have upgraded support, right?

During this time, the server got a little bit better- the usage statistics were implemented on the panel. They are wildly inaccurate. It would say our RAM was constantly maxed out and our CPU never reached above 1-2%. When I asked support they said that Its ""not a measure of what is being used, but rather what is available, I can assure you that you're not using all of your RAM."" All the while our server was nearing 400-500 ticks behind, constantly.

I opened several support tickets, one on my subdomain not working, one on players unable to connect through the IP address (only some players, despite being whitelisted), and on server performance (which I only did because their live chat support would urge me to write a ticket). Ticket response times were upwards of FOUR days.

Live chat and support ran me in circles trying to swap my server off of vanilla and adding plugins to control lag, which I begrudgingly did- nothing improved. Then, upon requesting RAM once again they told me that the server was not using its current resources and this could not be granted.

I cannot in good conscience recommend MCProHosting, especially at that price point.",,"{'time': 1590099143117, 'text': 'Hey Liko!\n\nWe‚Äôre sorry to hear that your review had been removed!

They also asked if I needed my bed (part of my itemized list) disassembled and reassembled (something I completely forgot about) at no extra charge - wow! Other places had a fee for the furniture assembly process.

All of my questions were answered immediately within less than 24 hours and Esa (the owner) checked in with me periodically from April 2021-June 2021 to see if I needed anything else as well as confirmed my move with me 3 days prior to the scheduled move date in June 2021.

Esa and another gentleman arrived 15 minutes early to ensure logistics (e.g. where to park so they could load my stuff, elevator access, time my move-in appointment, etc.) and began to work immediately. Sooo friendly and genuinely cared about helping me as much as possible given I live alone. Great conversations while packing and both had such a great spirit (did I forget to mention it was 100 degrees outside - yikes!).

The entire process I was extremely happy with both of my movers :) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!

Very affordable rates and honestly (for me and my needs) the best price in the DMV area.

They do not allow refunds or even partial credits for advance purchases of subscription months paid well in advance. I paid a years worth of subscriptions totaling near a thousand dollars and we had to close our doors due to the pandemic. We missed the annual renewal by only a matter of weeks and now I am having to pay for a years worth of services I do not need because we went out of business.

I am extremely hurting financially due to this advance purchase and after repeated attempts to try and come to a reasonable compromise they refused. Not even a single dollar refunded for any future months.

Everything that I liked about the software was tainted by the fact they have not allowed me to cancel or be refunded for future months I have not yet used.  It is extremely disheartening knowing they have taken my money after I wished to cancel knowing how much of a hardship they are causing.",,"{'time': 1611179773893, 'text': ""Hi Jennifer, We're so sorry to hear that you were disappointed with our customer service, as that's something we deeply pride ourselves on here at Goodshuffle Pro.

Monthly payments is the more flexible option, but annual payments offer an added 10% savings for upfront payments that buy a year of access outright. For both options we do not offer refunds for unused days or months.""}",0x89b7b7ea1da115c1:0x3983023571086bfa,GOOD

They informed me the only solution was to go back to my recipient and TAKE THEM AWAY FROM  HER. Haha! And in order to give her something else in return, they'd charge me extra for delivering a satisfactory bouquet!
I spent $75 today to get a basic arrangement that, in my experience in the industry, cost about $40, and came in one of those cheesy vases the crappy online florists mail for free. And the only solution they offered, after arguing with me, was to take away my sister's flowers!
I'd be even angrier if I wasn't so entertained by Nosegay's ridiculous solution to their mistake and poor judgement. I sent them a photo and in the end, they stood by the ""designer"" and put the customer last. If you want my opinion, order off the website ONLY and hope you don't get the same ""designer"" I got. ... because my sister is sitting at work with an oversized, poorly shaped collection of cheap flowers, which I'm still trying to decide is worse than no flowers at all. #disappointment #customerservicefail",,,0x89b7b7b7791f80d1:0x3613c6e41f6e7a47,GOOD

I payed $3600 cash for a car from these scammers.

Drove it around, everything was fine except about 20 minutes into the ride home the ""chime"" started going off. (sound you hear when your door is still open or your seatbelt is not on).. It chimes 15 times and than stops for a while than it will start again when the car starts.

A google search says that the 15 beeps means that there is a problem with either the airbags or the instrument panel.

I found a mysterious bolt laying on the floorboard when i bought the car.
Open up the instrument panel to check, and low and behold the Airbag LED had been crushed with some tool probably needle nose pliers.

The bolt i had found on the ground was 1 of the 4 that holds the instrument panel to the dash (there was only 3 on when i opened it)- MEANING that Everage auto was fully aware that the vehicle did not have airbags - or there was an issue causing the Airbag check light to display, and they knew it would turn off a potential buyer so they sabotaged it.

Needless to say I took the car back and got my money back.

I had the privilege of working with Heather by accident. It all started several years ago, when we were looking for a last minute photographer. I stumbled on Heather and I was very fortunate that I did. Heather was very responsive, she went above and beyond to take and deliver the picture in a record time, all while remaining within budget and on time.

I was very impressed by her professionalism and work ethics. So, when the time came for my wedding, I thought she would be the best and only person I can trust with the most important day of my life. Once again, Heather went above and beyond in capturing every special moment of that day. Her ability to use the landscape, colors and filters were incredible. Heather is truly an Artist and one that take much pride in her work.

After reviewing the final pictures of the wedding, I wanted to surprise my wife with an Album of my most favorite memories from that day. Once again, Heather was there and she was instrumental in making this project much easier and more fun! The final product was AMAZING and it certainly made a beautiful gift for my wife.

As I am writing this, I realized that this should have been three reviews lol. But my point is, Heather is a very talented artist and if you are getting married or engaged or whatever the occasion is, I strongly encourage you to invest in her services. Your big day is a once in a lifetime event and having Heather and her artistic vision will ensure that you have the memories of this day last forever.

Thank you Heather for being the beautiful artist and person you are. I certainly appreciate all your hard work.

COMMENTS:

During our Pet Blessing Event at Shain Park in August.  I have to say I absolutely Loved talking with Anna and her staff about their animals, and was even more in awe when I heard Most if not All of Carol & Anna's animals are Rescues!!  I had a horse of my own at 18 yrs old that was from a Auction, and then when I had children they grew up doing 4-H, with Horses and Rabbits.   Now they are grown and have moved on, our horses have past, and I now rescue rabbits and they are Service Animals and visit Nursing homes once a month üôÇ.  If I lived in the country and had the space, I would be doing exactly what Carol & Anna do!!  Congrats on doing such a wonderful job!!
I have attached a few pictures of our Pastor and her kids enjoying the Pony/Horse Rides and the Petting Zoo!  And Lots of pictures my daughter also took. Thank you Thank you!!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjhQtz-O_CGMzYesO1lH-bD8ebad4ADh79ILc2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

1.1375105618405912e+20,Tong Jin,1572282496705,1,"I rented a whole petting zoo for my wedding, and the event manager Desiree agreed on bringing the bubble machine & yard game & food for the animals. None of the item was showed or mentioned upon delivery. After the wedding, I reached out for refunds (it says on the contract,  $25 per non-showed item). They asked me to fill out a comment card, I did... but no response since then .... It is really disappointing that there was no communication, if they did not plan on bringing out the bubble machine etc, they should never get the full payment from me. Honesty is very important.
Update (10/28/2019)
THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE. I paid extra for the event manager for going out of her way and deliver the Alpacas. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE MY BANK ACCOUNT INFO, HOW DID YOU TRANSFER ME THE $50????  I have not received any email about your ""solution"". You should stop playing your little game and just do the right thing from now on.",,"{'time': 1572122447226, 'text': 'Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to advise us of your experience with our staff.  It\'s only through feedback such as yours that we are able to maintain and indeed, where necessary, improve upon the service that we provide to our valued clients.  After reviewing the event situation with your manager Desiree we learned that it was a ""gentleman"" at the event that advised us the machine and games were not needed.  As the event was a wedding everyone was very busy and we felt it was inappropriate to interrupt your wedding to ask if you were sure you didn\'t want the free bubble machine and games.  You paid for the alpacas however, we included pony rides free of charge. I understand you were disappointed because you feel you did not get all of the components you paid for.  And I apologize for the misunderstanding.  However, I wish you had also mentioned in your review that Desiree went out of her way (without charging you anything for the hat or her time)  to purchase a ""tiny top hat"" for the alpaca to wear because you requested it.   As for the refund, we did refund your deposit paid, please check your account.  You asked for a $25 refund and we gave you $50.  We are an honest company and are quite frankly insulted by your accusations.\nUPDATE RESPONSE*** Tong, we didn\'t have to get your ""bank account"" information to refund your $50 deposit.  You paid with a credit card and we simply hit ""refund"".  Here is a copy of the refund receipt and email we sent you.

1.050915576089962e+20,Areonna Dangel,1535318381283,1,"When I made the reservation originally, the lady was very nice and I was very excited to surprise my daughter with a unicorn pony. A couple of days before the event I spoke to my event manager desire and she was nice and we talked about everything and it was a pleasant conversation and said she will be there from 1:45-2:00. The day of the party, I called her at 2:15 to see where she was at and she told me she was running behind and asked if there was a place to turn around cause she got a new trailer and didn't know how to maneuver it very well it. I was completely understanding and polite and told her where she could turn around at and her daughter even came and looked at where she could turn around at before she tried to turn around to make sure she could. So the lady goes and turns around and completely destroys my yard in the process. I walked up to her once she had turned around to finally meet her and talk to her and she had a very nasty attitude and said ""so are you the person who's lawn I destroyed"" and I said ""yes but it's okay"" I was being very polite and understanding and she continued to have an attitude saying I should have told her and I'm like I did. I didn't know what she was driving and I thought everything was okay and handled seeing how she even had her daughter come and make sure before she attempted it. She went on to say she's not even going to have enough time now to make it to her next party and that the company shouldn't have booked her back to back like this. She was very nasty and made it seem like I was at fault and having them at my party was a huge inconvenience for them and after this conversation she asked if I still wanted her to set up, like duh of course I do, I go through all this, have my yard destroyed, be spoken to like total garbage. I can atleast have my child still happy and not have to deal with an upset child who's excited for the pony and animals after all this.
Once I hand her the money, I walk away and the girls continue to set up. Our kids go down there and are so excited. The teenagers who were running the face painting and letting the kids ride the pony had attitude and were giving attitude to the kids. The only girl who wasn't was this girl in a blue shirt who was running the opening and closing of the smaller pen. I understand children can be difficult sometimes and frustrating but you are at a birthday party and can talk nicely to children. You don't have to yell at them. It made me very uncomfortable at my own party. I hired these people to entertain the children and I have to watch them speak badly to my friends children in front of them. I was very on edge and felt very uncomfortable and was made to feel like everything was my fault for some reason. I don't do this for a living, they do. I don't know how things should be but I do know that when you are a professional you do not blame the customer for not knowing and you definitely do not make someone who is paying your paycheck feel like they are an inconvenience. You put a smile on your face no matter what and do your job calmly. The animals were beautiful and the girl who did the face painting did an amazing job painting but the people working had a very negative vibe and it made me and my guests very uncomfortable.
I eventually walked away and my sister n law did tell me when they were leaving to tell me that they were sorry. I throw many parties and the quality of the animals and face paint were great but next time I'm going to spend my 400 dollars on a company who is actually nice to their customers. I'll even pay extra to not be made to feel like I was. It's truly disappointing.",,,0x883cb52cd5a96877:0x72a687ad79cbffd7,GOOD

1.0827267874250102e+20,Katie Williamson,1472421954195,1,"This was a sad day for me. After booking our August event in March, I made sure to keep up with the emails and communication. I had a very difficult time contacting anyone, and finally got a hold of someone the Friday before our Sunday event (I had tried phone and email). I voiced my concerns to the head of the company, and was assured everything would turn out wonderfully.  The head of the company would be in touch with my event manager for me and all was well.  The day of the event I sent a text to my event manager and she had no idea who I was.  I called her and she didn't remember my event and said she missed the communication about this.  She quickly yelled at me to give me our address and said she'd be late. At this point our congregation was eating lunch, and I announced the animals and pony rides would be here but a little later.  An hour later my event manager called and left a message saying her trailer brakes were locked and she wouldn't be able to make it. On the message she said, sorry, bye. I tried to get in touch with the head office (she assured me she was in all day even Sundays), but the phone kept going right to voice mail.  It was a sad day because we had to tell many children and others that the animals were not coming. We heavily publicized this event, and people were so excited for it-especially for the pony rides.  Last year, our church had problems with this company too. They got confused and had to split a petting zoo and bring us half of what we had booked.  I have never written a public review before, but needed to share this experience. Make sure to call them until you get an answer, but even if you do, good luck.
I hope you figure things out with your company, Chamberlin. I had lots of crying kids looking at me because of you. It's time to move on and forgive, but I can truly never recommend you to anyone else.",,,0x883cb52cd5a96877:0x72a687ad79cbffd7,GOOD

1.1097315680638535e+20,Tara Larocca,1539115498652,3,"Poor communication on everyone's end! I had a party scheduled and it took me 4 days of
Phone tag to get in touch with my ""party planner"". There was suppose to be horrible thunderstorms on the day my party was and I wanted to cancel
Due to having to postpone my party to the next day. They were not available to do it the next day so I asked for a refund (who wouldn‚Äôt). Let me explain that on their website it says absolutely no where about not being able to refund any money. (I had my husband who is an attorney look at this). It only says they will cancel or transfer to another day. Since this was not possible because they were unavailable I asked for a refund. I tried everything to transfer it to the next day but they seemed very unwilling to do so. The lady (manager) is extremely rude on more then one occasion. After she told me this was canceled and I WOULD be refunded,  3 young girls showed up to my home and claimed they had no idea that this was canceled?! It was not their fault but more of the mangers fault for not telling them. They bash other companies on their website and claim that they are the best around, but maybe instead of doing that they should take a good look at how they run their own company!  I have never experienced such poor communication and compassion for my kids party before. I am still waiting on my refund of my deposit.
As I have seen from other reviews on here instead of the owner taking responsibility for how her/his employees treat clients, maybe instead of making exscuses you should learn from it, apologize and try to make it right. As a business owner myself, I would never allow my employees to treat paying customers this way. Reputation and word of mouth is everything. Yes you have a lot of good remarks BUT you also have some bad ones. You can‚Äôt say that every bad comment is in the wrong now?!

1.0559419621927422e+20,Tonya Bliss,1498536370635,1,"I hired Chamberlin pony rides for my son and daughters birthday party. It was an absolute nightmare! I purchase the complete party package which included for 1 hour - unicorn(pony), full size horse, 12-15 animals, face painting, balloon twist, music, games and a bubble machine. The party started out great. The staff was nice. About 20 minutes into the party the full size horses was spooked! The horse reared up throwing my 4 year old son off almost coming back down on him. When the full size horse did this it spooked the pony (unicorn) which caused the child (1 year old) on the pony to fall off. The staff didn't ask how the children were till after I told them to put the horse and pony up and after making excuses as to why the horse was spooked. So the horse and pony were only out for 20 min because I told them to put them away. They had another small horse in a small fenced area by itself that got out and tried taking off. There response to this was ""the horse isn't trained well""! Why would you bring a horse to an event with small children that isn't trained!? They did not do balloon animals which was part of my package and I paid for! The only thing we were happy with was the face painting and the small animals. I emailed Chamberlin pony rides the next morning letting them know what happened and they haven't called or emailed me back. I'm very disappointed! I will never hire them, attend a party their at or refer them to anyone! Thankfully no one was seriously hurt or killed!!",,"{'time': 1498599910084, 'text': 'We are so sorry you were not 100% satisfied with your party.  As a company we pride ourselves in our perfect satisfaction record, one that has earned us the distinction of being voted Metro Detroit\'s BEST entertainment company.  While we respect your viewpoint, I feel it\'s important we remind you of a few things you forgot to include in your review.  I understand there was an extremely loud AUTOMATIC DEER FEEDER that went off suddenly in the middle of your party. I\'m sure you will agree that this very loud unexpected noise would startle even the calmest of horses. When you reserved your party we sent you set up information that specifically asks you to remove anything in your yard that could potentially startle the animals.  We suggest in the future, if you do hire another pony company for your child\'s party, please dismantle or remove anything in the yard that could cause injury to the children.  Again, I am also very glad no body was hurt in the incident.\n\nRegarding the miniature horse that was in the small enclosure. While our riding horses and ponies do go through hours of rigorous training for safety reasons, we find it a bit challenging to train a tiny miniature horse not to want to get out and visit the children. However,  I honestly don\'t feel that his training (or lack of) is a safety concern for the children.\n\nYour comment that the staff didn\'t ask how the children were until later was a little surprising.   As our event manager remembers it, she didn\'t have any time to speak with you because you were very focused on apologizing to her for having the automatic deer feeder unexpectedly go off and loudly shoot grain in all directions causing the horse and pony to be startled.\n\nRegarding the balloons,  I understand your party turn out was much higher than you had anticipated.  While we do offer face paint and balloons with our events, we also state the total number of  faces and balloons we can physically do in an hours time.  Again, I\'m  sorry we didn\'t point this out to you more clearly at your party. We are very glad to hear you felt our staff was ""nice"" though.\n\nFor anyone who is not familiar with what an Automatic Deer Feeder looks like, please follow this YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KGOQI3kr5g'}",0x883cb52cd5a96877:0x72a687ad79cbffd7,GOOD

1.0097594005343035e+20,Stephanie Chandler,1534950433431,1,"About a week and half before our event I placed a reservation through gig master. I didn‚Äôt hear anything so I decided to call good thing I did because they didn‚Äôt see it. As I made my reservations so Saturday the 18th the reservation lady Sally confirmed everything for 3 pm on Saturday the 18th. She said I would need to call the event lady Debbie a few days before the party to go over everything. Which I called Tuesday or Wednesday the week of and Debbie advised me that she don‚Äôt have my party in here schedule she had to look and see where I was placed at. After she look she said I was with Cindy and she gave me her number. I was not notified at all that I was switched from another party coordinator. On Thursday Cindy called me to go over everything she confirmed my 3-4 and told me what I needed, all was good. Then Friday morning she called me again to go over what we just covered and I replied ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt we go over this yesterday‚Äù she said yes but she want to confirm again. Okay that‚Äôs fine, she then said so were schedule from 1-2? I replied back No, I am set for 3-4 and we went over this yesterday. I even have it in email. She said she has it for 1-2 things god messed up etc. Then she ask if we can meet in the middle since she has another party from 5-6 and she had to go to Washington. Unfortunately I set 3-4 for a reason. SO I ask for a discount since I would have to change my time and schedule for her to come earlier. She said what kind of discount I wanted, I said I‚Äôm asking you what you can give. She said I can get glitter for the kids that don‚Äôt come off since they will be swimming now and will have the face painting wash off since they are coming early before the party is over. I said no. She then said my party as a hardship on her team because I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be with her and I was placed with her and I am taking away her animal person and a face painter so she has to scramble to make things work. I immediately said excuse me did you just say my party was basically an inconvenience on your team because they placed my party onto you. She said yes and I was so mortified I said if it best I can cancel. She said is that something you want to do. I‚Äôm like no this is a day before the party and you already confirmed everything and now it is a huge problem.

I couldn‚Äôt believe she just said all of those things to me. She has horrible customer service skills and managing her team. The girls were great and did apologize on her behalf and said she is known for doing this to customer. Honestly I shouldn‚Äôt even have paid. I should have just gave the girls their tips.
SO last but no least the ending. I emailed the reservation lady sally and another lady email back (Monica Rupp) wrote me and said I‚Äôm very glad you are all set. I‚Äôm sure you will be very happy with the event. Again, Cindy has had some personal issues and is under a lot of stress. I‚Äôm sure you can understand. We all try to be perfect. However, it sounds like it was a miss communication and is now resolved. ( is this what companies say to its customers?) (RIDICULOUS)

We must have asked her questions on and off for over 6 months prior to being ready to purchase.  The being ready to purchase had more to do with cash flow than anything especially since Julie was SO prompt and thorough in answering our questions.  Prior to finding Julie - we had stopped at a few stores to ask questions about their saunas and we left knowing for certain that we would not purchase from them due to their lack of knowledge.  We've always felt like we've been in amazing hands with Julie.  Her knowledge is beyond what you can imagine.  After buying, there has been no drop off in her customer service either.  She still responds just as promptly and thoroughly!  So now that I've shared how much we appreciate Julie and how awesome she is at taking care of her customers, let me share my biggest health change since using the sauna.  So I suffer with CIRS (for me a combo of Lyme and mold issues) and virtually any time my heart rate came up at all (sometimes even just climbing a flight of stairs), I would get a horrible headache that would typically last the entire rest of the day.  Since starting with the sauna, I was able to shovel heavy snow for 1 1/2 hours straight 2 days in a row and NO headache either time.  It's seriously a miracle  I feel hopeful that I can once again start exercising!  I know more changes will come, and I do feel more energy during the day, so I'm excited to see what is ahead.

1.0609235489525385e+20,Julia J,1591418317423,5,"I have wanted my own sauna for years but we never had the space when we lived in the more metropolitan areas and overseas. After moving in the past year and getting space for one, I really dug in and did my research. I landed on clearlight as THE best across-the-board especially when it came to quality, low EMF, and hitting the right parts of the spectrum for infrared. I had heard about them on several podcasts and other forums but thankfully had a friend who had purchased through Julie and kindly pass along her information. Initially I was like ‚Äúwhy do I need an intermediary to buy a sauna?‚Äù
Well let me tell you.....

1) bat phone- Julie was accessible and knowledgeable from the moment I reached out to her for an inquiry up until the time we finally received/assembled. Anytime I would shoot her a question about timeline, electrical requirements, financing, she got back to me incredibly quickly with an answer.

2) Red light therapy - thought I had researched to death all of the nuances from near, mid, and far infrared but after going over it on the phone with her I realized what exactly I was looking for and what I needed/didn‚Äôt need.

3) size ‚Äì I‚Äôm fairly certain if I had gone directly to Clearlight I would‚Äôve been pressured to ‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù. Julie even looked at pictures of my space and help me decide whether I want an outside or inside unit, how large what material etc.

4) financing ‚Äì we initially reached out before all this Rona craziness started and ended up wanting to finance rather than pay cash once our sauna was ready. Julie immediately pivoted and set us up with the option we needed for simple, streamline financing. Like seriously, it was approved and processed in less than 5 minutes once we decided what option to go with.

5) price- oh, And did I mention she had a better deal than going to clearlight directly? Cha-ching

Hopefully this review will help others in trying to make their own decision about where to get their heat fix ....and also provide a little more gratification and thanks than the sweaty, yet smiling, selfie of our first session.",,"{'time': 1591420857287, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words Julia.

Long story short, the entire purchasing process literally took about 10 days from the day of initial contact with Julie to placing our order with her, and the faster-than-promised shipping & delivery to our home. Julie was there to assist us every step of the way to ensure a smooth transaction. We received the sauna the day before Thanksgiving, which we were super grateful, as it was perfect timing for us to install it over the holiday weekend. Julie‚Äôs professionalism extends beyond the purchasing process, she continues to message us to check if we have any questions or need any further assistance.
A million ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to Julie Bishop for playing an instrumental part in making my Clearlight sauna dream come true‚Ä¶ and the other million ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to my beloved husband (of course!) who supported our smart decision to invest in THE BEST sauna on the market as part of our journey to achieve optimal health! We would highly recommend Julie Bishop if anyone is interested in learning more about Clearlight saunas, Microbe Formula products, or simply curious about topics related to root cause, healing, and detox! She is truly a gem and we‚Äôre so grateful that our paths have crossed! Thank you so much, Julie! We love it!!",,"{'time': 1575836519031, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the amazing review.

Julie is the most honest and caring person in business that I have EVER come in contact with! I am sooooo glad Julie Bishop helped me realize true quality and now that I have my sauna set up I SEE how VERY different Clearlight is!  I would like to point out some of those qualities about this Beautiful sauna.
One of My favorite little added bonus...I can hook my MP3 player up with an aux jack and it can also recharge at same time! The speakers are amazing and they sound great!

The control unit for adjusting the heat isso easy to use...I did not even need to read directions..Heat up down and time so simple and so headache free!

The sauna contains chromotherapy!  ---the lights change color..There is a little button on the side INSIDE the sauna to turn it on but you can ALSO use a  little hand remote to change the colors or select random so ALL colors come up. Color has helped me to change my mood-especially on COLD winter days!

The heaters on the doors and they are amazing...I am surrounded by heat...these huge heaters cover the front and when I am seated I have heaters ALL around AND down by my legs. I don't know if you can see in the pictures of the sauna's,  but look close as there is a seal that closes the gap between the 2 glass doors-(great to keep heat in!) and 2 long metal pieces--YES! These are heaters!

None of the pictures show this but...There is an AWESOME heavy duty cord that stretches out over the top 10 feet! That is so amazing and how awesome that it is long enough NOT to worry about having to plug it into an UNSAFE extension cord!

I just can't say enough good things about this sauna and I am so thankful I did not buy the ""junky one"" I was going to. I saved up that little extra money and it was so worth it and worth the wait in receiving (kinda like you know you are at a GREAT restaurant when there is a line).....thanks again Julie Bishop for helping me get this and get it too my home---it is heavy duty weighing 600lbs coming off the semi...but with Julie's HELP we could follow it ALL the way to my home!

My daughter joined me for the class and it was excellent quality time spent together. These classes are a wonderful gift to friends and family interested in learning something new.

Communication: Shankari sent online meeting details well in advance of the class, including the recipe so that I could gather all the ingredients for the cook-along. She shared ingredients from her own pantry with local participants!
Punctuality: The class started on time, and finished well in time! Amazing! Most cooking classes go over time but Shankari managed participants that were slower than others very well, without any pressure.
Delivery: Shankari has a natural style of teaching that puts all ages at ease. She includes history of the recipes without being pedantic.
Accessibility: Shankari‚Äôs recipes have ingredients that are accessible. The techniques she teaches do not need special gadgets or appliances. The best part is that you cook in your own kitchen, with your own tools.

Later that evening I stepped outside and felt weak in the legs, like that feeling you get after an intense workout at a gym. In football we'd call that feeling the ""attack of the cat"" because your muscles are rubbery and weak as a kitten. I shrugged it off, saying, ""Nah. I know I went hard at it, but this thing couldn't have brought on the kitten.""
Folks, my quads, calves, chest and back are SO SORE! I don't think I'm doing cardio during lunch today!

RedgeFit, you get much respect. A product that does as advertised. I'll be buying more resistance bands soon. Eager to get my ""Holy Swoll"" on! Thanks for a great product!

The gravy, however, liquefied his guts, which was unfortunate because he liked it a lot. We tried several times over a week or two to integrate it without any luck. Pitbulls are notorious for being super sensitive though, so it's probably him and not the products. Easy to make, inexpensive, and good quality ingredients. Overall a good product. Just not something we can repurchase due to his apparent sensitivities.",,"{'time': 1563295534498, 'text': ""Hi Jennifer, We appreciate your taking the time to write and tell us about your positive experience with the treats.

She starts off by providing you with a quick overview of her process and then delves into whichever session you've selected. As most people may wonder, is she the real deal? I believe she is. It's difficult in readings to understand everything that is called forward but once you're able to process, you are able to validate a majority of the things brought forth. And those that aren't immediately validated, I believe they will be. The things mentioned regarding people who have passed were spot on whether it be about our time together when they were on this side or their acknowledgement of things that occured after their passing. Now, onto Jo. She's EVERYTHING. She's so awesome, down-to-earth, supportive and yet direct. I love everything about this lady. She has a blessing and I truly appreciate her sharing her gift with others. I wish her nothing but peace, love, prosperity and happiness. Thank you Jo!

You‚Äôre reading this review to see if she‚Äôs ‚Äúlegit‚Äù or the ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù which is totally understandable but believe me when I say I was blown away at what she revealed to me. I didn‚Äôt say a word to her and she told me what spirits were present with us. The exact people I MENTALLY thought and called to be with us she revealed to me were there. It was UNREAL!!

It‚Äôs been about a week and a half and after our medium session I have come to a wholesome understanding that the pain and sadness I was feeling for the deceased is all for null. I need to drop that because it is heavy energy that‚Äôs weighing me down. My past family is fine and happy. It‚Äôs my turn to move on and make something happy and great for myself.

In less than 5 minutes being seated, she told me that someone is trying to connect with me, a woman, very motherly, loves to cook I kinda already knew who it was, but when she dropped her name and told me that this person knows there‚Äôs an occasion/birthday... it blew my mind. Psychic Jo told me that this person is showing her rose garden, and she‚Äôs seeing lots of rose. (She had rose garden, she loves gardening when she was alive).
I also wanted to connect to my cousin, Psychic Jo wrote down lyrics of a song (before I got to her studio) that my cousin and I used to sing together. It‚Äôs insane.

We are all in our 20s and 30s and we‚Äôre hopeful but also very very skeptical. Josephine was able to connect with each and every one of our family members. There were things said that would be impossible to know unless she were really communicating with our loved ones. She brought us all comfort and peace and every single one of us was blown away by the reading. Some of us have done this on our own with a few other mediums and not gotten anything remotely close to the information that Josephine was able to provide. We all left there with happy tears and fuller hearts. I will definitely be going back to see Josephine with my parents. I am a believer in Jo.

I was nervous because it was my first time. Jo was wonderful, she connected with the one person I wanted to connect with right away. The things she said gave me no doubt that he was there with us. I got kind of frustrated, because other than the one person I wanted to connect with, nothing else made sense to me.Well, let me tell you, after the reading was over. I went into the other room, and found my son's girlfriend on the couch crying. She had been listening in on the reading. Every other person that came through was her family. from her dad, her Aunt, her brother, and even her son. Every name, and every word that was said, she told me who and what they were in her life. I will be coming in for another reading next month. I am hoping to connect with my loved ones. But Jo is 100% the real deal. I wouldn't be coming back unless I was absolutely convinced she was who she said she was. Looking forward to speaking with her again!",,"{'time': 1548843909130, 'text': 'Ty xo'}",0x89c4f356fd7123a5:0x880128d00ef9841b,GOOD

Believe me, my father is not the type to volunteer information, so he seemingly entered this reading looking for Jo to prove something to him. I‚Äôll get back to the reading in a second and start at the beginning...

Booked through her website with PayPal so I felt confident that the purchase was protected. Was contacted within an hour to schedule the appointment. Jo was very accommodating with the dates and times.

I dropped my father off for what was to be a 45 minute to an hour reading. Just about an hour later he came out with a new expression. It was hard to describe, but with each story we all kept saying, ‚Äúhow would she know that?‚Äù, which really built our confidence. My father shared a paper with us that Jo used during the reading to jot notes and images of things she saw. We could clearly see certain memories come to life. I‚Äôm sure this review isn‚Äôt doing it justice, but would highly recommend if you‚Äôre even thinking of making the appointment, do it. My father woke up the next morning telling us he actually felt much better than he had been feeling - like a weight had been lifted.

Highly recommend. Life changing experience.",,"{'time': 1542200693472, 'text': 'Thank you John, I was honored xo'}",0x89c4f356fd7123a5:0x880128d00ef9841b,GOOD

Jo was able to connect with our spirits we wanted to connect with. She was accurate on her connection with them and was able to answer questions that we needed answered. At the time there was two things that didn't make sense there was a letter S and a park Rd or parkway . Later that night one of my sons was driving home on park Rd and went around a S turn hit black ice and his car swung around and he was able to get control of the car quickly with the slightest movement and that was the son in which my our son (his brother) who is the spirit we connected with was standing next to saying park Rd .

I came for a reading for myself in which to my surprise she already had an entire page of information ready before I got there that was 100 percent spot on with my life, that alone was amazing since we only corresponded briefly through texts prior. By the end of my reading I felt an indescribable energy flowing through my body which has helped put my mind and body at ease ever since.

I also had her connect with a loved one I lost, this was very hard for me especially when Josephine began mentioning things corresponding to my loved one. I wanted to connect mainly to see if my loved one was watching over me and Josephine assured me she was. This helped put my heart at ease.

I tried to set up an appointment, but due to my schedule was not able to make it happen, but during that discussion I found out that she also did phone/skype readings and she said that the information comes through in the same way.  A few weeks later I made an appointment to speak with her on the phone.  I believe in mediumship, but I also believe there are people out there that aren't the real deal, so I was very open, but also appropriately wary and I was not going to automatically make links to things that I didn't think were concrete.  So we got started and WOW!  Everyone I wanted to speak to came through with very specific un googleable details.  She said the specific random small town name related to where a recently deceased relative had a car stored in a (which was a big part of his life) and passed along his advice for keeping up with the repairs (it was so him).  She referenced the same loved one being there during a specific conversation involving his sons and again he gave his advice regarding a tv antenna being moved - she brought up the antenna!  This was a big topic of conversation in the family and he had given his advice prior to his death and he was coming through to let us know that he still thinks we need to do it this specific way - lol.  My best friend's father came through with a message for her and also included in it his mother's name and a saying that his ex wife used to say to him.  My friend came through and referenced a specific movie (Old School from 15 years ago) we saw.   There are so many other examples, but I will stop there.  I wrote everything down and over the past week I've realized the clear associations with some of the things that I didn't think of at the time.  I'm only a week out and there is not much left that hasn't fallen into place.  She is really amazing and I would recommend her to anyone - in fact I have!  Thank you so much Jo - it has been an amazing week thinking about our reading and those messages.",,"{'time': 1537405584483, 'text': 'Amanda, the pleasure was all mine xo'}",0x89c4f356fd7123a5:0x880128d00ef9841b,IRRELEVANT

So either they lied and didn‚Äôt try to get it approved in the first place or they got it approved and lied about that. After confirming with our warranty company that everything was approved, they then called us being super rude and accusing us of ‚Äúmessing up the claim‚Äù and having to get re-approved.

I waited for almost 3 weeks for them to JUST START the job to fix a busted water line before I decided to go with someone else. There was always an excuse, he got caught up at another job, the weather LOOKS like it could rain, the yard still hadn't been looked at by the utility company to make sure we aren't going to hit anything. If you use this company be prepared to hear ""we are looking at tomorrow before I can get out there"" on repeat, but tomorrow never comes. I waited for a week for my yard to be marked (by the utility company) so he could start digging. After getting held off day after day I decided to call the company that was holding us up myself and they said that they had just gotten the call the day before and that they had 72 hours to come out...this was after I had already been waiting for 5 days. I had been waiting without water with 3 kids (which he knew) and he hadn't even made the call in the first place. When it was actually GO TIME and everything had been marked and we could get to actually fixing the busted water line is when the excuses started. The yard was marked at 7:30am. I sent him a photo around 8-8:30am. I didn't get a response till 10:30am telling me that its a tight squeeze and it looks like it might rain (which I told him it was clear skies where I was at and my weather app doesn't mention anything) We texted a few times and I had received ""I am on my way"" around noon. Around 1:45 I text him asking where he was. He stated in Dry Ridge getting the equipment then he was heading my way.....that never came. He said that he didn't want to get a job started that day because it was already 2pm in the afternoon. Mind you I sent a text first thing that morning. I am also a customer that was supposedly ""not taking any jobs for bc I am his top priority and he is just waiting on my yard to be marked so we could start immediately!

Made comments on everything we owned and invaded privacy stayed in our driveway for over 4 1/4 hrs . Used what we had in our possession to explain that we should expect to be charged this amount made it sound like well if you can afford this than you can pay me more.  He could  have had the job done within 1 I/2 hrs or less. Will never call these folks again. Thought is was very unprofessional and very disrupting staying so long for what he accomplished. He spent most of his time in his truck sitting and we fill like he way over charged us for this job and was very disrespectful when we confronted him about how much he was charging. We dont mind to pay for things, but this was very out of the ordinary for someone to act the way he did.",,,0x8841eb4e48d313bd:0x56630139ea44c0ba,GOOD

Had to go through them with our American Home Shield warranty. They came out last September and poked a hole in our ceiling to show that the stain was from an old leak, so we basically paid for them to come, poke a hole in our ceiling, and then had to pay someone else to come and fix the hole. They came September 8th for the garbage disposal and two leaky faucets. Fixed the disposal, put something on the faucets to see if it would fix it, said they'd call in a few weeks to check, and they'd have to check with the warranty company about an old faucet. I call the home warranty company last week (end of October) to see where the claim was. No claim had been submitted. AHS called them to tell them to get on it, I called them. I gave them another week after it was accepted (they kept trying to blame the warranty company), and a call did come in to make an appointment. It was on voicemail and my husband called back very soon after and they said they'd call us back. Just called them, they said they forgot and would call us next week. We just cancelled our warranty because it makes us go through Thomas and Sons, and it's definitely not worth it.",,,0x8841eb4e48d313bd:0x56630139ea44c0ba,GOOD

This company was forced on me by the home warranty company who will not get involved with this problem now. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with EVER!

1.1184287008638743e+20,Karen Mendnehall,1497314102299,1,"This company is not even worth one star.  DO NOT EVER USE THIS COMPANY! The problem started when my home warranty company sent an order to them to look at my water heater.  Twenty-four hours later, and still no call.  When I did call, Tiffany, the person who answers the phone for Thomas and Sons, said she never received the order.  After hearing her go through some papers, she said she finally found the order.
She sends somebody to my home to tell me I need a new water heater.  Yes, I knew that already.  They charged $75.  That is fair.  Then they tell me they can not locate a short 50-gallon water heater anywhere in the city.  Really?? I told Tiffany that I just saw several at Lowe's and I would be willing to get one and have them put it in if that is the issue.  Tiffany told me they would ""make it work""and keep looking for a water heater and she would schedule me for installation in two days.  I told her that it was imperative that I have it fixed as I was leaving for vacation the following week.
Then, the day of installation, she calls to tell me that they still can't find a short water heater so she took me off the installation schedule.  I told her I had called my warranty company to complain because at that point I was five days without water.  I said I had called another plumbing company to come out and see if my water heater could be replaced within the next day.  Again, Tiffany promised that they would figure something out and make it work and asked me to call my home warranty company to cancel the cash-out of using another plumbing company.  Wanting to give this company the benefit of the doubt, AGAIN, I canceled the other plumber and the cash-out option.
Now this is where it really gets good...the day the plumber shows up, he arrives at the very end of the time frame when he was suppose to be at my house.  He said he couldn't call me because his phone wasn't working.  He arrived with a tall water heater that wouldn't fit with the ceiling in my basement.  Duh, you already knew it needed to be a short model.  He left to take it back to the supplier and comes back an hour later with another tall version.  He proceeds to work in my basement for SIX HOURS then asks me to see what he had done.  In an attempt to make a too tall water heater fit in the spot, he demolished an entire section of cement around my chimney sleeve and not sure what else he did.  He proceeded to tell me he would need to come back the next day because he didn't have all the parts he needed.  He kept making it seem like it was an impossible job and I kept saying that if he brought the right size water heater or at least admitted they were not able to complete the job, I could get another plumber and pursue the cash-out from the warranty company.  He promised he would be back the next day at 11:00 am to finish the job.  Again, I stressed that I was leaving for vacation in two days and needed the job done.
The next day arrives. The hours pass and no sign of this guy.  He finally calls me at 3:00 and leaves some message that even the transcriber on my iphone could not discern what was being said. After waiting several hours, I had left my house.  He proceeded to go to my house and when my son got home, he said that he couldn't get to my house sooner because his cat died.  First his phone isn't working...and now a dead cat?!?
I called another plumbing company who came out today and job completed in four hours.  The little liars at Thomas and Sons told my home warranty company that they actually installed the water heater so I am denied a cash-out.  Told Thomas and Son to come and get their water heater.  Tiffany was going to send a tech right away to get it.  Ten hours later and it is still sitting in my yard and I am leaving for vacation.  I anticipate it will still be in my yard upon my return.

But at the same time it's the middle of summer where air conditioning systems are running nonstop and everybody's is breaking down all at once.

My Guys Moving and Storage was referred to me. I spoke with Terry and he was very professional, quoted pricing for the move, and was responsive to what we needed. The movers showed up on time inspected the items to be moved and wrapped and covered everything. The next day everything was delivered and setup in my mom's room very carefully with no damage. The guys were great and worked hard. Ashley kept me updated. Very fair and reasonable pricing for quality work. I plan on using My Guys Moving & Storage in the near future for another move.

1.1706651631270724e+20,Dana DiPasquale,1624394200642,2,The movers were supposed to call 30 min prior to arrival so I could collect my pets. They didn‚Äôt. Only 1 of 5 movers spoke English so we were unable to communicate with most of them. Had to show them how to remove drawers from furniture and then they let us do all of them. Numerous items were damaged. Furniture that wasn‚Äôt ours was delivered. They refused to disassemble some furniture and put it in the correct room. Put heavy items in garage instead of asking what room in the house to put them in. Specifically told not to move certain things but they did and damaged them. Damaged walls and ceilings. Dirty handprints over 5 newly painted walls. Ripped items anchored to walls off. Didn‚Äôt place furniture too heavy for us to move ourselves where we asked. Lost numerous parts. Claimed to be working longer hours than they did. Disappeared at lunchtime and charged us for that time. Unfortunately the claims process has also been disappointing. Company representatives don‚Äôt reply to emails or voice messages. Sales person has no contact with claims person so has no knowledge of client satisfaction or problem movers. Sales person said claims based on fair market value. Claims says it‚Äôs based on age and weight. A month has gone by and no resolution nor communication indicating all required forms have been received. Fairly certain based on this behavior we will get screwed.,,,0x89b7b7b23de5b10b:0x58790278103b8cce,GOOD

1.0794576888003958e+20,Shannon Cady Zeballos,1600559030309,1,"BEWARE. Extremely disappointed. Our office move was planned for 7 hours. I assume the movers are paid hourly because it took 13. They did not leave until 10:30 PM on a Friday night. Our contract included 5 men and a project manager, Kenny. We had 4 men and Kenny was on site for no more 15 minutes then completely ignored my staff member‚Äôs repeated calls while she had to manage the crew and tell them how to do their jobs, which they were under equipped for despite the lengthy on site pre-visit and contract discussion. The crew obviously did not have enough experience and a complete lack of attention to detail even in front of the customer. I watched them bump our tables and other furniture into things and overall they were the most inefficient movers I have ever dealt with and I have managed at least 6 moves. The moving crew showed up completely unprepared to properly wrap our LCD monitors and TV‚Äôs, did not know they were supposed to also take the mounts (included in the contract was to remount our TV‚Äôs and glass whiteboards), almost left a very large production window, left two lamps sitting outside of our old suite, and didn‚Äôt close the door properly so Datawatch called me because the alarm was going off. In addition, they did not have the crate included in our contract for my boss‚Äô glass desktop and dented the sides of the wooden base - a $5,400 piece of furniture that they clumsily fumbled to his new office. They also broke a piece of glass that they failed to wrap when they tipped my other boss‚Äô desk to carry it inside. To add insult to injury, we had to repeatedly ask them to put their masks on. When my employee was managing them at the pickup site and she asked them to put their masks on and keep their noses covered, one gentleman laughed in her face and told her he didn‚Äôt wear masks. At the drop off site I had to ask this same gentleman where his mask was. He said it was in his pocket. I literally had to tell him to take it out and put it on. He was making no moves to do so before that. Every time I saw the guys who were in our suite, while very nice, I still had to tell them to put their masks on their noses. At current time, 200,000 people have died in the US from COVID-19. For such a large a company, I‚Äôm floored by this experience.",,,0x89b7b7b23de5b10b:0x58790278103b8cce,ADVERTISEMENT

1.0402425838147676e+20,Michael Franzinger,1547217061583,2,"Buyer beware. This company attempts to contractually obligate customers not to post negative reviews, so the positive averages are skewed. I give them two stars only because the moving crew itself was great. Everything involving the office and management was an utter disaster.

Before hiring them, I asked whether they were insured for our stuff. They said yes. This is misleading at best, because their policy is capped at $50, even if they do thousands of dollars of damage to an item. Even to get the $50, one must go through a lot of back and forth with their staff, and they insist you sign a release promising not to post any negative reviews about the company (I haven‚Äôt signed).  Use your own judgment as to whether you‚Äôd be willing to deal with a company that engages in this practice.

That capped off a comedy of errors on moving day, where the company had somehow not internalized my request that the movers do the packing, and they spent hours obtaining packing supplies (after being two hours late due to ‚Äútraffic‚Äù). The move that the office said would take a few hours, and which they staffed accordingly, ended up taking until almost 3 AM and costing almost double what the company has estimated (even with packing services).  The moving crew suffered through this with great patience and endurance, so that was the one bright spot.

Whatever moving company you choose, I recommend asking very pointed questions about their policy toward damage of items, and get a copy of their bill of lading. Good luck all.",,"{'time': 1562608429533, 'text': 'We don‚Äôt ask customers not to post negative reviews. Sometimes customers post their dissatisfaction before even telling us that they are unhappy.

I was moving in Washington, DC and requested quotes from several moving companies. They were one of the lowest bids but my decision to use them was solely based on the guy I talked to on the phone. He inspired me with his experience and knowledge. He knew of the area where I was moving and reassured me that the movers would help packing the difficult items I had not found boxes for, such as my 55‚Äù TV, floor lamps, large picture frames, and oddly enough, my kitchen aid mixer. The guys who moved me showed up early and were very polite. They informed me about the steps that they were going to go through and asked lots of questions, giving me the impression that they really cared. Once we were all packed up, they followed me to my new place and went the extra mile to help me setup my bed and position all my furniture.

1.0187408691571032e+20,Allen Jackson,1484238568312,5,"I approached MyGuys Moving with a complicated logistical problem: 4 storage locations and a townhouse I had to move into a single-family house. The complication? Things had to move and be set up in order (rugs before bed, wall-sized cabinet before couch, etc. Things had to be disassembled and reassembled without losing parts, wires, or instruction manuals. Some items were large and bulky and there were a hundred (or more?) boxes of various sizes. All this HAD to be done the Friday after Thanksgiving (a long story). The plan went flawlessly. Wow.
I a giving MyGuys Moving a 5-star rating because from beginning to end, my needs were understood, my idiosyncrasies were accepted (or humored), and the whole families anxiety was keep to a minimum. I could not ask for better and I frankly expected less.
Here was my process. First, a MyGuys representative physically came to my townhouse to estimate the job. I am glad it worked that way - I knew I had some variations on the 'move from A to B' and I wanted to know the price up front. I had just thrown everything into buying the new place and I was into a very strict cash-management mode. We then discussed truck sizes, the numbers of guys it would take, and built in timing estimates. Since we were going from 'We live HERE this morning and must live THERE this evening', some things would need to be packed and then unpacked.  The rep assured me they would bring extra boxes (which they did).
The estimate was size based (mostly) since my stuff is bulky but not heavy (no old 357 big block engines lying around to move). I also have a mix of old and new furniture, plus a piano (opps, it is pretty heavy!).  What surprised me is that everything was wrapped in plastic film prior to being moved - meaning no scratches, strap marks, or stray dings. Very kool. I was astounted at the process - obviously well rehearsed - as a dresser or bed frame would go from standing to fully wrapped in 60 seconds or less! My 3-year old was a big help - not - since he kept trying to join the ""game"" of wrapping and moving to stuff, but the guys were very patient with him (THANKS!).
The only glitch was my fault - I underestimated the amount of stuff I had in storage and it took longer to get it out of storage than we anticipated. To my astonishment, MyGuys accepted my error as their own and kept to their price estimate despite it adding an extra hour or so to the time and level of effort. One has only to be in my situation to appreciate how emotionally important such professionalism is to keeping the stress level manageable!
Here is the happy ending: By the end of the day we were moved in, set up, and getting the kids bathed, reading them their stories, and putting them to bed. For a guy, his wife, and 2 little ones, that is an always desired, but not always achieved, blessing.",,"{'time': 1484241241443, 'text': 'This is amazing~~!

We have been doing Plan Your Visit for 9 months and a 6 week follow up for 2 months. We were using our own systems and methods like Mail Chimp, CCB Mail Merge, and regular texts. I had been old school texting every guest for 6 weeks. We have 10-20 guests every week. So I was sending 60-120 individual, personal texts plus replies, etc EVERY WEEK! The time... let's just say my world was spinning out of control.

Then... My Lead Pastor saw a Text In Church email and told me to check out a webinar. You guys told me what I have been telling them- texts get opened more often. I tried you out and put my regular process into an automated flow and sent all 6 weeks of info to my pastors super quick (in one day). They approved and HALLELUJAH - my job just got a whole lot easier. All I have to do is put my guests into my system and then watch them respond to me throughout the week. The guests who don't want to talk to us can still be in the system via the digital connection card if they chose.

We also traded out our previous Plan Your Visit form for a digital card. Again...Amazing!

My PYV Guests automatically get a text from me asking which service they would like to plan to visit (which opens our dialogue pre-registering kids, etc), a detailed email from me, and then a text telling them I can't wait to see them.

This makes me more available to coordinate volunteers and Journey Teams!

Also- The Text In Church Support Team is SUPER RESPONSIVE, Caring, and Helpful!

Thank you!

I believe that Mr. Starr was unable to be objective about the value of my home. He disapproved of the moving chaos/clutter (a moving deal was offered to me without my house being on the market but I only had 4 weeks to pack while working full time). Since Mr. Starr disapproved of all the moving boxes, he chose to be punitive about what he thought was my lifestyle rather than actually looking at the home and asking questions. He claimed that no updates had been made to the home for 15 years when in fact, I had lived there for 10 years and made multiple updates including a new furnace, finishing the basement family room and bathroom, new doors as well as a number of other updates. He seemed to seek out comps at the oldest limit legally allowed that would allow him to greatly devalue the property rather than using more current sales as a base point. To be fair, Mr. Starr may have been unfamiliar with the market in our area but I also believe that he did not bother to educate himself. Oh, I should mention that I studied and passed all the courses to be an appraiser myself but did not enjoy the work while apprenticing so chose a different career.  I would not recommend this appraiser.",,,0x87f6214a9c645935:0xb9ce03256d8e804,GOOD

Unfortunately this company asked for $3,000 and told me that the damage was so bad that they might not even be able to salvage any data. I then discovered CCW Tech online and loved that they are local, more than half the price, and also had excellent reviews. I asked the company to ship back my drives and when they found out I was taking them somewhere else, my fears came true - they purposely sabotaged the drives and the damage was irreversible. They told me I would regret my decision. When CCW received the drives they informed me that the damage was pretty bad. They had tried all they could think to do and hadn't had any success extracting data, but they weren't ready to give up yet! They had one more idea, and needed to order a new head but let me know that it may or may not work. They were up front and honest yet hopeful.  I fasted for three days and prayed and then Allen called me back with amazing news!! He said it was a MIRACLE! They worked endlessly to make it happen and never gave up.

Prior to this Driving School, I had no experience whatsoever in driving.  It didn't matter though, because I passed my driving test on the first try with the experience from the school's weekly lessons.  The instructor was very friendly, knowledgeable WITH a lot of common sense, and incredibly professional (never late, always a good few minutes early, showing he's always prepared for his clients).  He's the guy you can trust and will guide you from being a newb into an actual driver.  The lessons you take from here are at a nice steady pace.  Even though learning to drive can put a lot of weight onto your shoulders, going to this school, specifically, will take a TON of it off and help you refocus on your learning.

Although this was my very first Driving School, understand that I had no reason to seek out another because of how great this school was.  Also, I don't normally write recommendations or positive reviews, but this was such a great service that I'm advising you to prioritize it over all of your other choices.",,,0x8090536cac079115:0x741f89670f45312e,GOOD

Even though it was very late, Josh came and re-keyed all of our locks. His prices are more than reasonable, no extra fee for after-hours, also re-keying locks and getting copies of the keys was way less than expected.

He was going to come by the next day, but called me back and told me he was coming right over. Our safety was his first concern. He was efficient and very personable.

He told my son how to disable his vehicle (his keys were the ones stolen) and he will be back in the morning to re-key his vehicle. He offered to disable the vehicle, but my son declined and said he would take care of it.

Josh restored our sense of security. It was very unnerving knowing someone had a key to our home and our address. Feeling less stress now!

It was around 5pm on a Saturday night and someone had stolen my wife‚Äôs keys form her shopping cart while inside Sam‚Äôs Club (watch for this scam ‚Äì they were probably going to steal the car as soon as she left the parking lot). Scott was able to come to her location and create an ignition/door key for her on the spot (fortunately her driver‚Äôs license was not stolen and of course the registration in the glove box was there to prove ownership of the car). It even took Scott an hour to make the key because it was some special kind of key, which he did not charge extra for. He saved us from having to tow the car (since all the dealers were now closed and could not make a key for her until Monday), or worse, have the car stolen. She actually saw the guy (suspected thief) loitering in the parking lot the entire time until the locksmith showed up ‚Äì at which point he split, so we‚Äôre confident that was the thief‚Äôs plan. Anyway, Scott was great. He was prompt, courteous and very competitively priced and did not even charge for the extra time. Fantastic locksmith!

Not only is she extremely talented, but she is a pleasure to work with. Living in the Philadelphia area, planning a wedding remotely was a bit stressful, but after meeting with Megan, we had complete trust in her ability to get the job done right. On top of that, Megan has such a fun, happy personality which made it very easy to relate to her and be comfortable in front of the camera for the more formal shots--it felt like a friend was attending our wedding, not someone we had only met twice previously. The day of the wedding she handled herself so well! She had the perfect balance of stepping up and taking direction when needed, and then sliding into the background for candid shots as well. On top of that, she got our photos back to us so quickly (around 4-5 weeks) and the photos are all soooo beautiful. It's hard to pick and choose which to get printed. She is so talented!

PS. Another thing we really liked about her wedding package was that there were no ""time restrictions"" like other photographer packages we came across during our research. It was nice to know that Megan would be there for all the important moments and we'd pay a flat rate and not have to worry about paying by the hour.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAP7rBFHATB5FYNnuqD7iJ9F7bm2PamudlWuZp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMsm3_ufyHEtApeH6MxzrcG3NQIBhyRCXHOWEG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x89d6ca71c145720d:0x8efcdf41751a7395,GOOD

When we luckily were referred to Megan in 2012, we had no idea the impact she would carry forward in our lives. Megan worked tirelessly to make us feel comfortable and relaxed as we ""modeled"" for our engagement photo's. She then completely blew us away with her attention to detail, use of natural light and creativity with our wedding photos. Including, pulling us away and distracting us from a transportation issue we had on our wedding day, (terrible shuttle service, delayed the wedding by an hour) to capture the incredible October sunset, we would have otherwise missed. Most recently, she photographed the innocent, simple beauty of our first born daughter. Her patience in managing our fussy 2 week old baby went beyond our wildest expectations. She even came back a second day at her cost to get more pictures. Needless to say, I could go on and on about why Megan will be  a part of our lives for years to come. I think perhaps the best way to endorse her both personally and professionally, is to share publically, that she is and will always be a welcome part of our home.

I sent a text to Wish! They responded almost immediately and were super reassuring on the phone. They got me an appointment for removal the same day and a full set the next  day.

They were super attentive to my concerns. They had me fill out a eye health questionnaire. They carefully assessed what I needed for my Lashes and whether or not i had an allergy to the adhesive. And when I got the full set put on they were soft, full, better than natural looking.

I recently completed my 5th trip with Explorer Chicks last week -I did the four day Smokey Mountain hike.

Before my first trip in 2018 I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up. Clearly one has to have a base level of fitness to sign up for backpacking/10+miles per day of hiking but the trips are structured in such a way to accommodate women of varying fitness levels. After 5 trips I can assure you that Explorer Chicks attract a very diverse group. For my Smokies trip Ages ranged from 30s to 60s. My co-hikers came from all over the country with different ethnicities and backgrounds.

The guides are what really make this company unique (shout out to Lauren and Kimberly). Explorer Chicks hires partners who excel at building a cohesive group. In this trip only two of the hikers knew each other before the trip. The remaining 8 were solo travelers. By the end of the trip we were all exchanging contact info and posting our experiences to the various social media platforms.

Quick review for the Smoky Mountain hiking/glamping trip

Day 1 challenging 12 mile up/back hike to the top of MT Cammerer. 3k mile elevation gain‚Ä¶ I think everyone‚Äôs feet were a little tired. The trail was rocky but as one who hates going downhill with a passion doable with no major slips

Day 2:  we changed up a bit due to group dynamics (and weather) and did what I would call a nature walk up to a pretty waterfall followed by a tour of a historic town/picnic lunch.  We had a few hours back at the luxury camping site to swim/nap then we headed into Gatlinburg for a moonshine/wine tasting tour

Day3:  we did a beautiful 7 mile hike to Charlie‚Äôs Bunion. The views at the top were fabulous. We got hammered by a storm on the way down. But even the rain didn‚Äôt dampen the experience

I totally support this company and will travel with them again. They have trips all over the US and to some really cool non US destinations.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI_FKdTXQjtLZugabYCA236GqCakjLR4tWSEe1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlOHtO59G3dA0mIhly2SIR7ky1phmoO1UoRYlT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKYE7xrF0JEgkyFCiVEWcAfnrKW0ixekrOQLId=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1626891279650, 'text': ""Thank you Tracey for taking the time to share your experience with us and all of Google.

First, the guidance and leadership of Nick and Becca was unbelievable.

They shared their experiences, their backgrounds and truly helped facilitate a connection with each of the attendees and the group as a whole.

Guuuuuurl book that trip! üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2016 was a bit of a rough year for me and was filled with some big life changes. To say the least I was not in a good place. I happened to come across EC randomly on the app Meetup and quickly started checking out all the adventures. I had never been out of the country before so the Dominican trip immediately caught my eye. It took me a few days, but finally decided I needed to go on this trip.

At first I was a little intimidated; I was a solo traveler on my first trip out of the country meeting up with women whom I‚Äôve never met. But, the minute I arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a very enthusiastic Nicki that intimidation went away. This is the exact trip that I needed, and let me just say you‚Äôll walk away feeling like such a complete BADASS!! My favorite part was probably the canyoning trip through Ciguapa Falls. It was a challenge and I loved it. I was sore the next day, but it was the good kind of sore. :)

I left the Dominican with new friends and feeling so empowered. This was such a great start to my 2017, and made me completely forget about my crappy 2016. Since then I‚Äôve been on the overnight backpacking workshop to red river gorge, and I can‚Äôt wait for more EC adventures in the future! üíú",,"{'time': 1512444182548, 'text': 'Abbey! Thank you!

Most impressive was their willingness to work with us on multiple drafts, getting everything just right.  We added pics, moved things around and even changed the whole look of the book more than once, and every exchange was quick and professional.  Note, even the most expensive album is priced less than a smaller set of prints from  a high end photographer.

It was super easy to upload our photos-- we just sent Tweed Wolf the link our photographer provided us, and then uploaded some additional photos from our friends. Then, they did all the hard work of selecting and arranging photos (with our input and feedback). We had unlimited edits to make suggestions and tweaks until the album was perfect. They made it so easy-- I am so grateful we chose not to wrestle with trying to DIY our album!

We could never have designed such a wonderful album on our own. The Tweed Wolf team turned our collection of photos into a lovely story that really captured the essence of our wedding day. When we received the printed album, I was thrilled with the quality of the printing and binding. We opted for the Luxe album-- so glad we did, because the designers made great use of the lie-flat pages (which are true lie-flat). The album pages were much thicker and more substantial than I expected. All around the perfect album for us and our families!

I should give a huge shout-out to the customer service team, especially Mary-Lynn Miller. She worked with us throughout the process. She has a true eye for creative photo arrangements that are just right for capturing your important moments. Not to mention, she is so thoughtful, kind, and responsive to any questions!

So why was I listening to Sarah to begin with?  After 30 years of being in large corporate environments, I decided to follow my dream of helping others reach the goals and dreams that are important to them.  However, not once in my life had I thought about, hoped for or wanted to start my own business ‚Äì and that‚Äôs where Sarah comes in.

The information Sarah shared at the workshop was so helpful to me, I scheduled a strategy session with her.  During our session, not only was I thrilled to hear how she would put her expertise to use for my business I also felt a ‚Äúconnection‚Äù with her; with that combination I knew I wanted to hire Sarah.

As we started working together, it didn‚Äôt take long to discover all the information she brought to her workshop only scratched the surface of Sarah‚Äôs knowledge and abilities.  Here are a few things I found as I worked with Sarah:
‚Ä¢	Sarah recognizes each business owner is ‚Äúunique‚Äù and she had more than one way to accomplish my goals.
‚Ä¢	Sarah has a vast amount of business knowledge and experience that she put to work for my business.
‚Ä¢	Sarah is resourceful and dedicated; she didn‚Äôt hesitate to explore new areas that would be beneficial for my business.

Our company was recently nominated for the BBB Torch Awards For Ethics.
I attended a BBB workshop designed to help prepare an entry for this prestigious award.
I hired Sarah Kowal of Right Now Enterprises to work with me to prepare our entry.
My only coaching for Sarah was ""we are in it to win it"".

Sarah hit the ground running.
She immediately made an appointment with the BBB to look over previous award entries and speak with MacKenzie, the BBB coordinator.
Sarah prepared an 8-section portfolio which included:
-Transformation At The Top
-Reinforce And Build
-Unite The Team
-Steer Performance
-Treasure People
-Enthusiastically Reinvest
-Supporting Documents

From cover to cover, the portfolio was impeccably professional:
-The cover had an enlargement of my company logo and company slogan ""Being Of Service - We Love It"".
-She coached me on writing the cover letter introducing my company to the panel of BBB judges.  The letter concluded with a final touch from Sarah: A portrait photo of me with my wife and business partner.
-Throughout the portfolio, prominent paragraphs such as our Mission Statement, were background highlighted in blue...the same blue used by the BBB official documents....a brilliant move by Sarah.
-Each page had a blue indented line border which made for an undeniably professional look.   The pages are heavy stock giving the portfolio a feel if indestructibility.
-She asked for names of my associated in the industry, contacted them , let them know we were nominated for the BBB Ethics Award, gave them some BBB suggested bullet points which resulted in 3 superlative letters of recommendation.

Sarah made germane requests of me which ultimately shows she engaged fully to produce the result of winning the award:
- 7 Most recent Angie's List Reviews
-Community involvement and donations, especially in my industry
-Make staff available for her to interview

She made an appointment for final printing only to be let down by the printer not being able to keep the appointment.
Sarah rescued  the situation by googling a printer in the same zip code, and found a mom & pop printer.  Knowing Sarah's enthusiasm and leadership, I was not surprised that the printer jumped at the chance to assist her.

Whether we win the award remains to be seen.
Know this:
The portfolio is a fabulous representation of our company which I am proud to display in my office.
Many portions of the portfolio will become part of our company website.
Should I ever sell the company, the portfolio is a great asset.

I highly recommend Sarah Kowal of Right Now Enterprises for all your business needs, whether it be coaching, analytics, profit & loss improvement, business growth strategy and any other of the myriad services she offers.

Sincerely,
John C. Thomas

I vowed to do EVERYTHING in my power to make sure I beat cancer so that I would be around to raise my 2 young sons.  I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, went through 15 months of chemotherapy, had a double mastectomy and a total of 4 surgeries in all. I slowly started exercising 6 weeks after my double mastectomy and now have gone on to run 8 half-marathons to date!  After I had my exercise program defined, I took a hard look at my nutrition. This is when the Plant Chics came into my life (at a time when I needed them most)!  I had unsuccessfully attempted to go plant-based two times previously.  But this time was different because I had the Plant Chics who gave me the support and education I needed to be successful on my plant-based journey.  They individually bring different attributes to the table and together are a powerhouse of knowledge. I have learned so much and feel such food freedom with tons of energy (and great blood work to back everything up as well)!  Wish I could give the Plant Chics 20 stars - give them a try (you won't be disappointed)!  To know them is to love them!!!",,,0x88d9b3faf4843565:0x3eeb0b5bf11e18ab,GOOD

I arrived at the ladies house (house, not store) while we stood outside, in the rain looking at picture‚Äôs of how his hair should be cut.  My puppy (who adores everybody) was scared of her.  Not being invited to see the premises and my pup‚Äôs reaction should of been warning enough.  The lady text me not long after saying she would have to shave him as his hair was matted.  He had been bathed and brushed four days prior - he is a cockapoo and runs around a lot, so by no means was his fur perfect.  But it was not beyond rescue.  I would of gone to get him as that‚Äôs not how I wanted him cut, but she started BEFORE informing me.  When I finally got my puppy home, I noticed he was over grooming and very sensitive about his paws.  Now that I‚Äôve checked, between his pads are raw and must be sore for him.

You were a first time client of mine, I do apologize for not informing prior, that I was shaving Simba down, I\'m so use to doing that in this neck of the woods, because it seems everyone cannot brush their long hair pets here! But I completely understand. I already said this to you, but for Google records I guess, he actually was pretty matted on the legs (not the body or head), and base of tail actually, I would have loved to save his hair, and was too excited to give you what you wanted because it was a hairstyle that I usually don\'t run into here, but as a creative groomer, was too excited to execute the style, and I could not tell upon first seeing him that he would be matted, because the top layer was so well brushed and combed, but the center, I unfortunately could not save.  However, I use a 30 blade to shave the paw pads so Im not sure if Simba isn\'t use to a 30 blade or if they just haven\'t been cleanly shaven in between the pads with a 30 blade, but I regularly use that blade size for all my dogs. Its possible his skin wasn\'t use to that close of a shave though. He didn\'t necessary like me clipping his nails, so I wonder if that could be it. He\'s alot better than most when clipping nails though, I have to say :-) Of course, if he\'s limping or the irritation does not go down, definitely see a veterinarian, but you already know that, im sure, sometimes I have to tell people though!!. ""Over grooming"" I think you mean, he was upset about his grooming experience or nervous, and yes, I was trying to get through his fur, tugging a little, and trying to brush out what I could before I just said ""nope"" and shaved him down haha , Barking dogs, new environment, different smells it\'s normal and I almost expect a nervous puppy (10 months old) to be nervous. Offering to see the grooming area, is always up to the owner, of course Im fine with it when someone asks to see the space, and always oblige.

I WAS SHOCKED THAT HE GAVE THAT INFO BEFORE RENTING ME THE TOOLS. ANY OTHER PLACE WOULD BE "" SURE WILL THATS THE PROBLEM ""  JUST TO RENT YOU THE TOOLS. BUT NOT THIS COMPANY  they go above and beyond to help to make sure that thats the issue. Ive never worked on a BMW  before this one. So once i got the valve covers removed i called tonys tool rental services and got allll the parts and the tools i needed, they even give you a EMERGENCY SPARE PARTS KIT  which in my case was a life saver , them keepers are so small you'll never find it and by the time you order 1 and by the time you get it you will loose 100% a minimum of 3-5 days just waiting on part.

I am in absolute awe of this company and how they stand behind their product, as well as the almost immediate response from customer service whenever I sent an email (quite a few because of a problem with my post office).
I should probably say before I go further, that I am thrilled with the final outcome and photo that Mixtile printed.
After my ordering, I received an email from the founder, Eytan.  This impressed me because he wanted me to know he was standing behind his product in case there were problems.
I had received a notice from USPS that my package had been delivered to my front door.  I went to retrieve that package, but there was none.  I proceeded quite a lengthy attempt to resolve this with my PO.  I filed a report that the package was missing and made several personal trips to the PO.  Longer story, suffice it to say, my package was never found, nor did my post office seem to care.  I know that the postal people are running ragged, but I never received a follow up from them.
I got in touch with Mixtiles to inform them of the issue.  Their solution:  no problem, we'll remake your order and send it out without a charge to me!  True to their word, it arrived today.  Oh yeah, I received an apology from Mixtiles that it wouldn't arrive until October 7.  I have no idea why they apologized and then to top it off, it arrived today on the 4th.  GO MIXTILES.
